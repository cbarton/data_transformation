Description:
    Stubs out a new database data transformation. Pass the transform name, either
    CamelCased or under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

    A transform class is generated in db/transforms prefixed by a timestamp of the current date and time.

Example:
    `rails generate data_transformation PopulateUsers`

    If the current date is May 14, 2008 and the current time 09:09:12, this creates the PopulateUsers transformation 
    db/tranforms/20080514090912_populate_users.rb
